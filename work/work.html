            Created during the GDES Study Abroad trip in 2024, Little Scratch is
            a project consisting of three zines centered around the graffiti
            culture in Italy. By collecting photos of graffiti from Florence and
            pairing them with images of ornate frames sourced from museums and
            antique collectors, the zines juxtapose modern urban expression with
            traditional art preservation. The exhibition audience became
            collaborators, invited to draw and add to the zines with markers and
            pens, creating an interactive exploration of art and culture.
            Through this project, I gained insight into the history and
            preservation of Italian art while experimenting with community
            guided creative processes.
